# Tracking the Impact of Healthcare Spending on Tuberculosis
Does More Investment Mean Better Outcomes?"
This project researches on how increased healthcare spending impact tuberculosis outcomes in death rates and new case rates across different income countries?

#Story:
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health challenge, with its burden disproportionately affecting low-income countries. The key question this project seeks to answer is: Does increased healthcare spending lead to lower TB death rates and fewer new cases?

To explore this, I analyzed TB-related health data across different income groups, comparing healthcare expenditure with TB mortality and incidence rates. My approach included:

Data exploration and visualization to identify trends and disparities.
Mock-ups and iterative design to refine insights and improve clarity.
Inspiration from global health research and visual storytelling to create a compelling narrative.
The final visualization provides a clear, data-driven perspective on how financial investment in healthcare correlates with TB outcomes. This work helps policymakers and stakeholders identify gaps and opportunities for strategic interventions, ultimately supporting more effective TB eradication efforts.
